# Silly Builder, Surgery is for Doctors
Rimworld "Silly Builder, Surgery is for Doctors" mod

See, there's this weird subtlety in how Rimworld jobs work.

The job definition says which work type is used for the job. So, for example, the "mechanoid surgery" job uses the Repair work type.

Which seems reasonable.

But there isn't necessarily any connection between what work type it *says* it uses and what skill it actually *does* use.

Mechanoid surgery is the same as all other surgery. Like all surgery, it uses Medicine.

Which is weird. Because we're talking mechanoids here. But that's what it does.

Changing it to *actually* use the Repair work type is pretty hard. But changing it to correctly link to the Medicine skill is pretty easy.

So now, your medicine-incompetent workers won't go try to remove scyther limbs. They'll fix stuff like they should, and your doctors will go take care of the scyther bits.

Does not require a new save game - this can be transparently added and removed from any savegame you already have.
